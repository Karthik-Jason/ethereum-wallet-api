Most servers are\n      protected via ECC. Bitcoin uses the same, as well as SSH and TLS and a lot\n      of other stuff. The Ethereum keys specifically are 256-bit keys, which are\n      stronger than 128-bit and 192-bit, which are also widely used and still\n      considered secure by experts.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In this you have a private key and a public key. The private key can\n      derive the public key, but the public key cannot be turned back into the\n      private key. The fact that the internet and the world's secrets are using\n      this cryptography means that if there is a way to go from public key to\n      private key, your lost ether is the least of everyone's problems.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Now, that said, YES if someone else has your private key then they can\n      indeed send ether from your account. Just like if someone has your\n      password to your email, they can read and send your email, or the password\n      to your bank account, they could make transfers. You could download the\n      Keystore version of your private key which is the private key that is\n      encrypted with a password. This is like having a password that is also\n      protected by another password.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      And YES, in theory you could just type in a string of 64 hexadecimal\n      characters until you got one that matched. In fact, smart people could\n      write a program to very quickly check random private keys. This is known\n      as \"brute-forcing\" or \"mining\" private keys. People have thought about\n      this long and hard. With a few very high end servers, they may be able to\n      check 100k keys / second. However, even checking that many per second\n      would not yield access to make the cost of running those servers even\n      close to worthwhile - it is more likely you, and your great-grandchildren,\n      will die before getting a match.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If you know anything about Bitcoin,\n      <a\n        href=\"http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/32331/two-people-with-same-public-address-how-will-people-network-know-how-to-deliver\"\n        rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        >this will put it in perspective:</a\n      >\n    </p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\n        To illustrate how unlikely this is: suppose every satoshi of every\n        bitcoin ever to be generated was sent to its own unique private keys.\n        The probability that among those keys there could be two that would\n        correspond to the same address is roughly one in 100 quintillion.\n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <p>\n      <a\n        href=\"http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/25375/why-not-use-larger-cipher-keys/25392#25392\"\n        rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        >If you want something a bit more technical:</a\n      >\n    </p>\n\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\n        These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices;\n        they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow.

The keys generated here meet that criteria,\n      as do Jaxx and Mist/geth. The Ethereum wallets are all pretty good. Keys\n      generated by brainwallets do not, as a person's brain is not capable of\n      creating a truly random seed. There have been a number of other issues\n      regarding lack of entropy or seeds not being generated in a truly random\n      way in Bitcoin-land, but that's a separate issue that can wait for another\n      day.\n    </p>\n\n    <h5>Related Reading</h5>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/6cjvam/probability_of_seed_phrase_collisionbrute_forcing/\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >BIP-39s (mnemonic phrases &amp; Ledger Hardware Wallets)</a\n        >\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a\n          href=\"https://kb.myetherwallet.com/security/ethereum-two-people-same-private-key.html\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >How does it ensure that it doesn't give different people the same\n          key?</a\n        >\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a\n          href=\"https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/30269/are-all-possible-ec-private-keys-valid\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >Not all private keys are valid on the curve</a\n        >\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a\n          href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography</a\n        >\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a\n          href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/734.pdf\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/734.pdf</a\n        >\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6s1wzp/probably_a_stupid_question_about_mew_vulnerability/\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >Randomness of Private Keys Explained</a\n        >\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h5>Sources</h5>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/6cjvam/probability_of_seed_phrase_collisionbrute_forcing/\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/6cjvam/probability_of_seed_phrase_collisionbrute_forcing/</a\n        >\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a\n          href=\"http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/25375/why-not-use-larger-cipher-keys/25392#25392\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/25375/why-not-use-larger-cipher-keys/25392#25392</a\n        >\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a\n          href=\"http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/32331/two-people-with-same-public-address-how-will-people-network-know-how-to-deliver\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/32331/two-people-with-same-public-address-how-will-people-network-know-how-to-deliver</a\n        >\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {};\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\n@import 'FaqContents.scss';\n</style>\n"]}]}
