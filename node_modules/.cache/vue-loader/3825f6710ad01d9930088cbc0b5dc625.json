First, you are responsible\n      for your stuff. Your investments, your choices, your security. There are\n      no babysitters or undo buttons or a bank to call up and reverse your\n      transaction. The power of the blockchain is this, but it's also a\n      dangerous thing if you are expecting to have all the cushy things you've\n      come to enjoy.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Secondly, most of the people involved in this world are pretty technical\n      and sometimes forget how different things are. Take your time, ask\n      questions, ask for clarification reach out for help, read the\n      instructions, read the warnings, hang out, and try to learn new things.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          <strong\n            >Scams and\n            <a\n              rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n              href=\"https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/static/faq.html#q1\"\n              >phishing sites</a\n            >\n            and malicious links exist.

How To Buy ETH\n    </h3>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Create an account on Gemini or Coinbase or Kraken.</p></li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          Verify that account. You will need to upload a wide variety of\n          documents proving you are who you say you are and stuff. It's all\n          regulatory stuff. Once you upload this stuff, verification takes\n          about a day or two (time is dependent on how busy the service is.\n          During times of price increases and tons of new users, it may take\n          longer. Be patient.)\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          Follow the instructions on the exchange to deposit USD into that\n          exchange. This, depending on your bank and the wire transfer, will\n          typically take 3-5 business days.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          Now you have USD in your exchange account and can buy ETH with it.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          Once you have all the ETH you want, withdraw that ETH into a wallet\n          that you control. Exchanges are notorious for being hacked (although\n          the ones mentioned above are very reputable) and you want your funds\n          in a place that you have the private key to. So...\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          ...While you are waiting for your verification and transfer,\n          download and install\n          <a\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n            href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases\"\n            >Mist / Ethereum Wallet</a\n          >. Run it so it can sync the blockchain.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>\n          When you run it, it'll prompt you to make a new account. Create a\n          password that you will never ever forget and create the account.\n          Then, it'll give you an address that starts with 0x.. This what you\n          will enter on your exchange to move your ETH from their account to\n          your own.\n        </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>To safely keep your account you have 3 pieces of information:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Your address (0x7573aB.....)</li>\n          <li>Your password</li>\n          <li>Your private key</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <p>\n      The private key is like a password, but way more intense. Plus, it's a\n      password that is protected by another password. In Ethereum Wallet, this\n      private key is in the form of a <abbr>keystore file</abbr>. You need to\n      make a backup of this in case anything happens to your computer.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In Ethereum Wallet, go to the top bar and find <abbr>ACCOUNTS</abbr>\n      <i class=\"fa fa-long-arrow-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\" />\n      <abbr>BACKUP</abbr>\n      <i class=\"fa fa-long-arrow-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\" />\n      <abbr>ACCOUNTS</abbr>. It'll open up a folder and inside you will see a\n      file. This file is your private key. Copy this to a USB drive and safely\n      store the USB drive in a different physical location than your computer\n      (in case your house explodes).\n    </p>\n\n    <h5>Alternative steps 1-5:</h5>\n    <p>\n      If you already have BTC, you can use Shapeshift.io, Bity.com, or\n      Changelly to convert your BTC into ETH. Start a BTC\n      <i class=\"fa fa-long-arrow-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\" /> ETH exchange and\n      it'll tell you where to send your BTC. (If you have your BTC on an\n      exchange, you can likely exchange them for ETH on that exchange without\n      the need for Shapeshift.)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Then create a Ethereum Wallet account and back it up. In Circle or\n      Coinbase, send all the BTC to that address. The ETH will appear in your\n      ETH wallet in ~20 minutes.\n    </p>\n    <h5>Alternative steps 6-8:</h5>\n    <p>\n      Mist is highly recommended but some people have issues installing &amp;\n      syncing it. If for some reason you cannot get it to run, here is a list\n      of easily accessible wallets. Follow the instructions provided by each\n      of these wallets to back up your information. In Jaxx, that is a\n      mnemonic. In MyEtherWallet,\n      <a\n        rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        href=\"https://kb.myetherwallet.com/how-do-i-move-from-coinbase-to-myetherwallet-exchange-slash-hosted-wallet-mew\"\n      >\n        read this </a\n      >.\n    </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Just, MAKE SURE YOU BACK IT UP PLEASE.</strong></p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.myetherwallet.com/\"\n          >MyEtherWallet.com</a\n        >\n        or\n        <a\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/44vbef/myetherwallet_chrome_extension_the_beta_has/\"\n        >\n          MEW Chrome Extension\n        </a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://jaxx.io/\">JAXX</a> -\n        multi-platform, multi-currency\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.exodus.io/\"\n          >Exodus.io</a\n        >\n        - multi-currency desktop app\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h5 id=\"refresher-course-\">Refresher Course!</h5>\n\n    <p>\n      I have outlined the steps above like you should do it all as fast as\n      possible. Stop. Breath. There is no rush. Take your time moving your\n      funds from an exchange to your own wallet. Test with a small amount\n      first. Get the feel for things and make mistakes with\n      <em>small amounts</em> rather than all your money!
