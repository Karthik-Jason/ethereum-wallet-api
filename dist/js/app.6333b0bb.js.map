Make sure you’re using a recommended browser, such as  Brave or Google Chrome.\\n2. Confirm that you have the latest firmware upgrade for your Ledger, and that the Ethereum app on your device is also on it’s latest version. (This can be checked via Ledger Live.)\\n3. Double-check there are no other apps using the Ledger that are open. (Ledger Live opens automatically, so make sure it's closed.)\\n4. Head into the Ethereum section of your device, and then open the 'Settings'. \\n   Make sure 'Contract Data' is turned to 'Yes' (if you see 'Browser Support', then your device is not updated). \\n5. Refresh the page, and check that you’re on the most recent version of MEW, 5.1.2 or above.\\n6. If that doesn't work, please try another cable.\\n7.
